		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Half-and-half, Whole Milk, or Heavy Cream: For extra rich flavor and the
				creamiest texture, use heavy cream. It’s delicious that way! But I
				usually use half-and-half for something a little lighter. You can also
				use whole milk. See below for best nondairy alternatives.
			</li>
			<li>
				Pumpkin Puree: You don’t need a whole can, so you’ll have some left
				over. Here are recipes to make with leftover pumpkin puree.
			</li>
			<li>
				Pure Maple Syrup: You’ll appreciate that we’re using a natural sweetener
				in this creamer. Make sure it’s the real deal, not the bottle labeled
				“pancake syrup.”
			</li>
			<li>
				Pumpkin Pie Spice: You can use either store-bought or homemade pumpkin
				pie spice blend.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cinnamon Sticks: Two cinnamon sticks infuse this creamer with so much
				warming flavor. I always keep some on hand in the fall, for making
				homemade apple cider and honeycrisp apple sangria, too!
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Preparation</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				You just need a saucepan and a whisk, and in less than 15 minutes of
				cooking, you have the perfect blend of fall flavors for your morning
				coffee.
			</li>
			<li>
				The base of coffee creamer is, obviously, dairy cream or half-and-half.
				For a dairy-free alternative, try using coconut milk, cashew milk, oat
				milk, or almond milk. Full-fat coconut milk will give you the thickest,
				creamiest result; other nondairy milks may be on the thinner side.
			</li>
			<li>
				One favorite way to enjoy coffee in the fall? Add a splash of homemade
				pumpkin creamer, then top with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon
				or pumpkin pie spice. Talk about dreamy.
			</li>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Flour: 2 cups of all-purpose flour is my standard amount for homemade
				scones, but set aside some extra for the work surface and your hands.
			</li>
			<li>
				Brown Sugar: I use either white granulated or brown sugar in my scone
				doughâ€”it depends on the add-ins. I love brown sugar with apples. Stick
				with about 1/2 cup. Feel free to slightly decrease, but keep in mind
				that the scone flavor and texture will slightly change.
			</li>
			<li>Baking Powder: Adds lift.</li>
			<li>
				Salt, Cinnamon, & Vanilla Extract: These 3 ingredients add flavor.
			</li>
			<li>
				Frozen Butter: Besides flour, cold butter is the main ingredient in
				apple scones. It adds flavor, flakiness, crisp edges, and rise.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heavy Cream: For the best-tasting pastries, stick with a thick liquid
				such as heavy cream or whole milk buttermilk. For a nondairy option, try
				using full-fat canned coconut milk. Avoid thinner liquids such as milk
				or almond milkâ€”the result is often dry, bland, and flat scones.
			</li>
			<li>Egg: Adds flavor, lift, and structure.</li>
			<li>
				Apples: Use your favorite apple variety. I love Granny Smith,
				Honeycrisp, or Fuji here. Whatever kind of apples you enjoy in your
				apple pie or apple cobbler, youâ€™ll enjoy here.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Preparation</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>I recommend grating the frozen butter with a box grater.</li>
			<li>
				Because thereâ€™s no yeast, these apple cinnamon scones go from the mixing
				bowl to the oven relatively quickly. First, mix the dry ingredients
				together. Second, cut shredded butter into the dry ingredients. You can
				use a pastry cutter, 2 forks, or your hands for this step. A food
				processor works too. To avoid overly dense scones, work the dough as
				little as possible. I always use a pastry cutter.
			</li>
			<li>
				Next, whisk the wet ingredients together. Pour the wet ingredients into
				the dry ingredients, add the apples, then gently mix together.
			</li>
			<li>Form the dough into a disc, then cut into 8 wedges.</li>
			<li>
				To obtain a flaky center and a crumbly exterior, scone dough must remain
				cold. Cold dough wonâ€™t over-spread, either. Therefore, I highly
				recommend refrigerating the shaped scones for at least 15 minutes prior
				to baking. You can even refrigerate overnight for a quick breakfast in
				the morning. Before baking, brush the scones with heavy cream and
				sprinkle with coarse sugar. These extras add a lovely golden sheen with
				a bakery-style crunch. After that, bake the scones until golden brown.
			</li>
			<li>
				The scones are INCREDIBLE right out of the oven, but taste even better
				with salted caramel on top. ðŸ™‚ What doesnâ€™t?! Other topping options: You
				can certainly keep the scones plain or dust with confectionersâ€™ sugar.
				Or try the maple icing from these maple brown sugar cookies, the brown
				butter icing from these pumpkin oatmeal cookies, or simply vanilla
				icing.
			</li>
